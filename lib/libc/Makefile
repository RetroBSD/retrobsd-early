# Machine dependent routines are located in a subtree which parallels
# the top directories.  This subtree is identified by the machine name.
#
# Compatibility routines are kept in directories with a prefixing
# ``compat'' (so they all sort together).
#
# The C run-time startup code is always machine dependent and expected
# to be located in ../startup-${MACHINE}.
#
# All files contain sccsid strings, but these are not compiled into
# library objects by default, as a space-saving measure.  To produce
# a library that contains these strings in every object except
# system call stubs, add -DLIBC_SCCS to DEFS below; to put these
# strings into system call stubs, use -DSYSLIBC_SCCS.
#
# To compile a non-floating point versions of some standard library
# routines add -DNONFP.  This will speed up some operations if you don't
# have hardware floating point.  To compile a non-separate I&D version add
# -DNONSEPARATE.
