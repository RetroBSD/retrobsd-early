# FIXME - The assembler/linker only stores the bottom 16 bits
# of the labels in pair, so we construct the address by merging the 16 bits
# in the cell with the upper 16 bits in the return address of the code that
# called this. Is there a way to get the assembler linker to store the full
# address? If so, that should be used instead.
