--------
Overview
--------
Retro is a concatenative, stack-based programming language with
roots in Forth. It is intended to be clean and practical.

All code, documentation, and any binaries included are provided
under the ISC License unless otherwise noted in the source. Please
feel free to take, use, and modify Retro as you see fit.

Documentation
-------------
Retro comes with a variety of documents describing the language,
virtual machine, and implementation details. Most of these are
in ReStructured Text (ReST) format and can be converted to other
formats using docutils. A stylesheet is included for HTML output.
