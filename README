This is the RetroBSD source directory.


Source Roadmap:
---------------
bin         User commands.

etc         Template files for /etc.

include     System include files.

lib         System libraries.

libexec     System binaries.

sbin        System administration commands.

share       Shared resources.

sys         Kernel sources.

tools       Build tools and simulators.


***************************************************************************

To build for the Maximite board, make the following changes to these files:

retrobsd/Makefile
    Select Maximite under section "Select target board"

tools/virtualmips/Makefile
    Select Maximite under section "Select target board"

Hardware changes are required to use UART4 for the console.
Lift the resistor** (see below) going to the audio output plug and connect
a MAX232 between the (now isolated) trace to pin 49 and the trace to
pin 43/RD9. These two pins are respectively the TX and RX pins of UART4.

** On the original Silicon Chip PCB as sold by Altronics this resistor is
R6 (5k6 through-hole). Pick up pin 43/RD9 at the rear connector.
** On the Dontronics SM1 version of the PCB this resistor is R8 (2k7 SMD).
A convenient pickup point for pin 43 is the feedthrough adjacent the PIC32.

For the bootloader, see the tools/HIDBoot_v1_3 directory. This will build under
Windows XP with both MPLAB 8.70 and MPLABX, the former makes a much smaller file.
The build can also be configured for UBW32 by undefining MAXIMITE in the compiler
build options. Provision has also been made for the 32MX695F512 (no CAN controller)
and the 'H' (64-pin) versions of the chip, which were all missing in the original
configure scripts. See HardwareProfile.h for further details.
