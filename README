***************************************************************************

To build for the Maximite board, make the following changes to these files:

sys/pic32/compile/Makefile
    deselect all default UBW32 options (DEFS), select all Maximite options

tools/virtualmips/pic32.conf
    deselect sdcard0 and select sdcard3
    change uart1_type to 'none' and uart4_type to 'console'

Hardware changes are required to use UART4 for the console.
Lift the resistor** (see below) going to the audio output plug and connect
a MAX232 between the (now isolated) trace to pin 49 and the trace to
pin 43/RD9. These two pins are respectively the TX and RX pins of UART4.

** On the original Silicon Chip PCB as sold by Altronics this resistor is
R6 (5k6 through-hole). Pick up pin 43/RD9 at the rear connector.
** On the Dontronics SM1 version of the PCB this resistor is R8 (2k7 SMD).
A convenient pickup point for pin 43 is the feedthrough adjacent the PIC32.

For the bootloader, see the tools/HIDBoot_v1_3 directory. This will build under
Windows XP with both MPLAB 8.70 and MPLABX, the former makes a much smaller file.
The build can also be configured for UBW32 by undefining MAXIMITE in the compiler
build options. Provision has also been made for the 32MX695F512 (no CAN controller)
and the 'H' (64-pin) versions of the chip, which were all missing in the original
configure scripts. See HardwareProfile.h for further details.
