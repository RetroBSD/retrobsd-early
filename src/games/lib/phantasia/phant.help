NAME
     phantasia - an interterminal fantasy game

SYNOPSIS
     phantasia [ -s ] [ -m ] [ -a ] [ -x ] [ -h ] [ -H ] [ -p ]

DESCRIPTION
     _P_h_a_n_t_a_s_i_a is a role playing game vaguely similar to dungeons
     and dragons.  It allows players to roll up characters of
     various types to fight monsters and other players.  Progres-
     sion of characters is based upon gaining experience from
     fighting monsters (and other players).

     Most of the game is menu driven and self-explanatory (more
     or less).  The screen is cursor updated, so be sure to set
     up the TERM variable in your environment.

     The options provide for a variety of functions to support
     the game.  They are:

     -s   Invokes _p_h_a_n_t_a_s_i_a without header information.

     -m   Get a monster listing.

     -a   Get a listing of all character names on file.

     -x   Examine/change a particular character on file.

     -h   Get a help listing (this message).

     -H   Get header listing only.

     -p   Purge old characters.

     The characters are saved on a common file, in order to make
     the game interactive between players.  The characters are
     given a password in order to retrieve them later.  Only
     characters above level zero are saved.  Characters unused
     for more than nine days will be purged.

PARTICULARS
     Playing in General

     Certain of the player's more important statistics are almost
     always displyed on the screen, with maximums (where applica-
     ble) in parentheses.

     The character is placed randomly near the center of a carte-
     sian system.  One may move by hitting E, W, N, or S (lower

     case may also be used, at no time is the game case depen-
     dent).  To move to a particular (x,y) coordinate, use the
     move ('1') command. The distance a character can move is
     calculated by 1 plus 1.5 per level. Moving in a particular
     compass direction will move the player the maximum allowed
     distance in that direction.

     A player may at any time see who else is playing with a
     players ('2') option.  One may see only those who are the
     same distance or closer to the origin as he/she.  Kings, and
     council of the wise can see and can be seen by everyone.  A
     palantir removes these retrictions.

     One can talk to other players with the talk ('3') option.
     In general, this is a line or so of text.  To remove a
     current message, just type <return> when prompted for a mes-
     sage.

     The stats ('4') option shows a players characteristics in
     more detail.

     One may leave the game either with the quit ('5') option, or
     by hitting interrupt.  Quitting during battle results in
     death for obvious reasons.

     One may rest by default.  Resting lets one regain maximum
     energy level, and also lets one find manna (more is found
     for larger levels and further distances from the origin).

     One may call a monster by hitting '9'.

     Several other options become available as the player pro-
     gress in level and magic, or to other positions in the game
     ( valar, council of the wise, king ).  These are described
     elsewhere.  In general, a control-L will force the redrawing
     of the screen.

     Other things which may happen are more or less self-
     explanatory.

     Fighting Monsters

     A player has several options while fighting monsters.  They
     are as follows:

     melee          Inflicts damage on the monster, based upon
                    strength. Also decreases the monster's
                    strength some.

     skirmish       Inflicts a little less damage than melee, but
                    decreases the monster's quickness instead.

     evade          Attempt to run away.  Success is based upon
                    both the player's and the monster's brains
                    and quickness.

     spell          Several options for throwing spells
                    (described elsewhere).

     nick           Hits the monster one plus the player's sword,
                    and gives the player 10% of the monster's
                    experience. Decreases the monster's experi-
                    ence an amount proportional to the amount
                    granted.  This also increases the monster's
                    quickness.  Paralyzed monsters wake up very
                    fast when nicked.

     luckout        This is essentially a battle of wits with the
                    monster. Success is based upon the player's
                    and the monster's brains. The player gets
                    credit for slaying the monster if he/she
                    succeeds.  Otherwise, nothing happens, and
                    the chance to luckout is lost.

     Character Statistics

     strength       determines how much damage a character can
                    inflict.

     quickness      determines how many chances a character gets
                    to make decisions while fighting.

     energy level   specifies how much damage a character may
                    endure before dying.

     magic level    determines which spells a character may
                    throw, and how effective those spells will
                    be.

     brains         basically, the character's intelligence; used
                    for various fighting options and spells.

     manna          used as a power source for throwing spells.

     age            number of seconds of playing time for the
                    character.  As age increases, many personal
                    statistics degenerate.

     Character Types

     Character statistics are rolled randomly from the above
     list, according to character type.  The types are as fol-
     lows:

     magic user     strong in magic level and brains , weak in
                    other areas.   Must rely on wits and magic to
                    survive.

     fighter        good in strength and energy level , fairly
                    good in other areas.  This adds up to a
                    well-equipped fighter.

     elf            very high quickness and above average magic
                    level are elves selling points.

     dwarf          very high strength and energy level , but
                    with a tendency to be rather slow and not too
                    bright.

     halfling       rather quick and smart, with high energy
                    level , but poor in magic and strength. Born
                    with some experience.

     experimento    very mediocre in all areas.  However, the
                    experimento may be placed almost anywhere
                    within the playing grid.

     The possible ranges for starting statistics are summarized
     in the following table.

     Type          Strength   Quick   Manna    Energy   Brains   Magic
     _________________________________________________________________
     Mag. User      20-25     30-35   50-100   30-45    60-85     5-9
     Fighter        40-55     30-35   30-50    45-70    25-45     3-6
     Elf            35-45     28-38   45-90    30-50    40-65     4-7
     Dwarf          50-70     25-30   25-45    60-100   20-40     2-5

     different character types, the characteristics progress at
     different rates for the different types as the character

     goes up in level. Experimentoes' characteristics progress
     randomly as one of the other types.  The progression as
     characters increase in level is summarized in the following

     Halfling      2.0       30       30      4.5     1

     Character types are identified by certain numeric values as
     follows:
     1: Magic User 2: Fighter 3: Elf 4: Dwarf 5: Halfling 6:
     Experimento

     Characters with one or more crowns are designated as a nega-
     tive type.  Kings have ten added to their type; members of
     the council of the wise have twenty added to their type.
     Valar are type 99, and ex-valar are type 90.

     Spells

     During the course of the game, the player may exercise
     his/her particular magic powers.  These cases are described
     below.

     cloak          _m_a_g_i_c _l_e_v_e_l _n_e_c_e_s_s_a_r_y: 15 (plus level 5)
                    _m_a_n_n_a _u_s_e_d: 35 plus 3 per rest period
                    Used during normal play.  Prevents monsters
                    from finding the character, as well as hiding
                    the player from other players.  His/her coor-
                    dinates show up as '?' in the players option.
                    Players cannot collect manna, find trading
                    posts, or discover the grail while
                    cloaked. Calling a monster uncloaks, as well
                    as choosing this option while cloaked.

     teleport       _m_a_g_i_c _l_e_v_e_l _n_e_c_e_s_s_a_r_y: 25 (plus level 10)
                    _m_a_n_n_a _u_s_e_d: 20 per 75 moved
                    Used during normal play.  Allows the player
                    too move with much more freedom than with the
                    move option, at the price of expending manna.
                    The maximum distance possible to move is
                    based upon level and magic level.

     power blast    _m_a_g_i_c _l_e_v_e_l _n_e_c_e_s_s_a_r_y: none

                    Used during inter-terminal battle.  Damage is
                    based upon magic level and strength. Hits

                    Used while combatting monsters.  Has a 25%
                    chance of working.  If it works it hits the
                    monster just enough to kill it.  If it fails,
                    it doesn't hit the monster, and doubles the
                    monster's quickness and strength. Paralyzed
                    monsters wake up much quicker as a result of
                    this spell.

                    _m_a_n_n_a _u_s_e_d: variable
                    Used while combatting monsters.  Hits the
                    monster based upon the amount of manna
                    expended and magic level. Guaranteed to hit
                    at least 10 per manna.

                    _m_a_n_n_a _u_s_e_d: 20
                    Used during monster combat.  Throws up a
                    shield to protect from damage.  The shield is
                    added to actual energy level, and is a fixed
                    number, based upon maximum energy.  Normally,
                    damage occurs first to the shield, and then
                    to the players actual energy level.

                    Used during monster combat.  Transforms the
                    monster randomly into one of the other 100
                    monsters from the monster file.

                    Used during combat with monsters.  Increases
                    strength up to a certain maximum.

                    Used while fighting monsters.  Makes it
                    harder for the monster to hit, by temporarily
                    increasing the player's quickness. This spell
                    may be thrown several times, but a maximum
                    level will be reached.

                    Used during monster combat.  "Freezes" the
                    monster by putting its quickness slightly
                    negative.  The monster will slowly wake up.
                    Success is based upon player's magic and the
                    monster's experience. If it fails, nothing
                    happens.

                    Used during monster combat only by valar or
                    council of the wise. Allows the player to
                    pick which monster to fight.

     Monsters

     Monsters get bigger as one moves farther from the origin
     (0,0).  Rings of distance 125 from the origin determine the
     size.  A monster's experience, energy level, and brains are
     multiplied by the size.  Strength is increase 50% per size
     over one, and quickness remains the same, regardless of
     size.

     Also, meaner monsters are to be found as one progress
     farther out from the origin.  Monsters also may flock.  The
     percent chance of that happening is designated as flock% in
     the monster listing.  Monsters outside the first ring may
     carry treasure, as determined by their treasure type.
     Flocking monsters, and bigger monsters increase the chances
     of treasure.

     Certain monsters have special abilities; they are as fol-
     lows:

     Unicorn        can only be subdued if the player is in pos-
                    session of a virgin.

                    and magic level.

     All the scrolls except general knowledge automatically call
     a monster.  Those that are marked with a * preserve any
     spells that were already in effect.  Those that call mon-
     sters are only in effect while in battle.

     Type five      _d_a_g_g_e_r - adds to strength.

     Type seven     _c_h_a_r_m - protects from cursed treasure (used
                    before amulet ); used in conjunction with
                    blessing to battle Dark Lord.
                    _M_e_r_l_y_n - adds brains, magic, and manna.
                    _w_a_r _h_a_m_m_e_r - like an axe, but bigger.

     Type eight     _h_e_a_l_i_n_g _p_o_t_i_o_n - sets poison to -2, or sub-

                    _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t_e_r - allows finder to move anywhere.
                    _s_w_o_r_d - like a war hammer , but bigger.

     Type nine      _g_o_l_d_e_n _c_r_o_w_n - allows the player to become
                    king, by going to (0,0).
                    _b_l_e_s_s_i_n_g - cuts sin to 1/3, adds manna, rests
                    to max., and kills Dark Lord with a charm.
                    _q_u_i_c_k_s_i_l_v_e_r - adds to quickness.

     Type ten       _e_l_v_e_n _b_o_o_t_s - adds permanently to quickness.

                    tle, etc.

     Any treasure type 10-13 monsters may instead carry a type
     nine treasure.

     A monster may also be carrying gold or gems. These are used
     at trading posts to buy things. A gem is worth 1000 gold
     pieces.  Too much gold will slow a player down.  One may

     carry 1000 plus 200 per level of gold. A gem weighs one half
     a gold piece.  Monsters of treasure type 7 or higher may
     carry gems.

     The chance of a cursed treasure is based upon treasure type.
     The more valuable treasures have a greater chance of being
     cursed.  A cursed treasure knocks energy level very low, and
     adds 0.25 poison.

     Rings

     Rings are only carried by nazguls and Dark Lord. They come
     in four different flavors.  All rings rest the player to
     maximum and cause him/her to hit much harder in battle with
     monsters (assuming one has chosen to use the ring for bat-
     tle.)

     Two types of rings are cursed and come either from nazguls
     or Dark Lord. After a few times of using these types, the
     player falls under the control of the ring, and strange,
     random things will occur.  Eventually, the player dies, and
     gives his/her name to a monster on the file.  Dying before
     the ring is used up also renames the monster.

     The two remaining types of rings are much more benign.  The
     one from a nazgul is good for a limited number of battle
     rounds, and will save the player from death if it was being
     used when he/she died.  The one from Dark Lord is the same,
     except that it never is used up.  rings disappear after sav-
     ing someone from death.  In general, cursed rings occur much
     more often than normal ones.  It is usually not a good idea
     to pick one up.  The only way to get rid of a ring is to
     have a monster steal it.

     King

     A player may become king by finding a _c_r_o_w_n and going to
     (0,0).  Players must have a level in the range of 10 to 1000
     to be able to find a _c_r_o_w_n.

     Once a player is king, he/she may do certain things while in
     the Lord's Chamber (0,0).  These fall under the decree ('0')
     option.

     _t_r_a_n_s_p_o_r_t      This is done to another player.  It randomly
                    moves the affected player about.  A charm
                    protects from transports.

     _c_u_r_s_e          This is done to another player.  It is analo-
                    gous to cursed treasure, but worse.  It
                    inflicts two poison, knocks energy level very
                    low, and degrades the maximum energy.  It

                    also removes a cloak. A blessing protects
                    from king's curses.

     _e_n_e_r_g_y _v_o_i_d    The king may put as many of these (within
                    reason) scattered about his/her kingdom as
                    he/she pleases.  If a player hits one, he/she
                    loses manna, energy, and gold. The energy
                    void disappears after being hit.

     _b_e_s_t_o_w         This is also done to another player.  The
                    king may wish to reward one or more loyal
                    subjects by sharing his/her riches ( gold ).
                    Or it is a convenient way to dispose of some
                    unwanted deadweight.

     _c_o_l_l_e_c_t _t_a_x_e_s  Everyone pays 10% tax on all gold collected,
                    regardless of the existence of a king. The
                    king may collect this amount with this
                    option.

     The king may also teleport anywhere for free by using the
     origin as a starting place.

     Special Places

     Certain regions of the playing grid have different names.
     In general, this is only to give the player some idea of
     his/her present location.  Some special places do exist.

     _T_r_a_d_i_n_g _P_o_s_t_s  These are located at |x| == |y| == n*n*100
                    for n = 1, 2...1000.  Trading posts farther
                    out have more things for sale.  Be careful
                    about cheating merchants there, as they have
                    short tempers.  Merchants are dishonest about
                    5% of the time.

     _L_o_r_d'_s _C_h_a_m_b_e_r This is located at (0,0).  Only players with
                    crowns may enter.

     _P_o_i_n_t _o_f _N_o _R_e_t_u_r_n
                    This is located beyond 1.2e+6 in any direc-
                    tion.  The only way to return from here is a
                    transporter or to have a valar relocate the
                    player.

     _D_e_a_d _M_a_r_s_h_e_s   This is a band located fairly distant from
                    the origin.The first fourteen monsters (water
                    monsters) can normally only be found here.

     _V_a_l_h_a_l_a        This place is where the valar resides.  It is
                    associated with no particular coordinate on
                    the playing grid.

     _W_o_r_m_h_o_l_e_s      At fixed locations on the grid are several
                    holes to underground defects in the playing
                    area.  Sixty-four chambers exist; sixteen of
                    which open to the outside world.  While in
                    the wormholes, one move by going forward,
                    backward, left, or right.  One can always
                    undo a move by going in the opposite direc-
                    tion.  The wormholes are mappable.  For exam-
                    ple, to move from the first wormhole {at (-
                    400,0)} to the second wormhole, type 'LL'.

     Miscellaneous

     There are several bits of trivial knowledge which fall under
     this category.

     A _g_u_r_u will never be disgusted with your sins if they are
     less than one.

     A _m_e_d_i_c wants half of a player's gold to be happy.  Offering
     more than one has, or a negative amount will anger the
     _m_e_d_i_c, who will make the player worse (add one poison ).

     The Holy Grail does little for those who are not ready to
     behold it.  Whenever anyone finds it, it moves.  It is
     always located within 1e+6 in any compass direction of the
     origin.

     There is a maximum amount of manna and charms a player may
     posses, based upon level. _Q_u_i_c_k_s_i_l_v_e_r is always limited to
     to a maximum of 99.

     _B_o_o_k_s bought at a trading post increase brains, based upon
     the number bought.  It is unwise, however to buy more than
     1/10 of one's level in books at a time.

     Players over level 10000 are automatically retired.

     A _b_l_i_n_d_n_e_s_s goes away in random time.

     Inter-terminal Battle

     When two player's coordinates correspond, they may engage in
     battle.  In general, the player with the highest quickness
     gets the first hit.  If the two players are severely mis-
     matched, the stronger player is drastically handicapped for
     the battle.  In order to protect from being stuck in an
     infinite loop, the player waiting for response may time out.
     Options for battle are:

     _f_i_g_h_t          Inflicts damage upon other person.

     _r_u_n _a_w_a_y       Escape from battle.  Has a 75% chance of

                    foe.    Has a 10% chance of working.

     Sometimes waits for the other player may be excessive,
     because he/she may be battling a monster.  Upon slaying a
     player in battle the winner gets the other's experience and
     treasures.  Rings do not work for inter-terminal battle.

     Council of the Wise, Valar

     A player automatically becomes a member of the council of
     the wise upon reaching level 3000.  Members of the council
     cannot have rings. Members of the council have a few extra
     options which they can exercise.  These fall under the
     intervention ('8') option.  One is to _h_e_a_l another player.
     This is just a quick way for that player to be rested to
     maximum and lose a little poison. The main purpose in life
     for members of the council is to seek the Holy Grail. This
     is done with a palantir under the _s_e_e_k _g_r_a_i_l option.  The
     distance cited by the seek is accurate within 10%, in order
     not to make it too easy to find the grail.  Seeking costs
     1000 manna. A player must have infintesimally small sin, or
     else it's all over upon finding the grail.  In order to help
     members of the council on their quest, they may _t_e_l_e_p_o_r_t
     with greater ease.

     Upon finding the grail, the player advance to position of
     valar. He/she may then exercise more and niftier options
     under _i_n_t_e_r_v_e_n_t_i_o_n. These include all of the council
     members' option plus the ability to move other players
     about, bless them, and throw monsters at them.  Valar are
     essentially immortal, but are actually given five lives.  If
     these are used up, the player is left to die, and becomes an
     ex-valar. Valar cannot _m_o_v_e, _t_e_l_e_p_o_r_t, or call monsters.
     Any monsters which a valar encounters are based upon his/her
     size.  Only one valar may exists at a time.  A player
     replaces the exiting valar upon finding the grail.  The
     valar is then bumped back to the council of the wise.

BUGS
     Many.  The whole program is a hack.  The handling of
     incorrectly exitted characters is a kludge.  The screen is
     set up assuming a 24 by 80 character screen; no attempt was
     made to provide otherwise.  If the program is not set uid,
     it crashes on the first attempt to open a data file.  If any
     of the data items get too big for the allotted space on the
     screen, no guarantees are made about what will happen.
