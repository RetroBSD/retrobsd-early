Like the rest of Retro, this implementation is provided under the ISC license.
However, there is an additional license in play here. Three files are provided
under the MIT license. None of these are used by Ngaro itself; they are used
soley to help provide a nicer user interface.

To avoid confusion, the following table lists the files under each license.

+------------------+---------+
| File             | License |
+==================+=========+
| | canvastext.js  | ISC     |
| | dumpImage.rx   |         |
| | index.html     |         |
| | ngaro.js       |         |
| | retroImage.js  |         |
| | theme.css      |         |
+------------------+---------+
| | idtabs.js      | MIT     |
| | jquery.js      |         |
| | tab.css        |         |
+------------------+---------+

Please note that while jquery and idtabs allow for dual licensing under both
MIT and GPL, Retro does not. We use these projects under the MIT license only.
