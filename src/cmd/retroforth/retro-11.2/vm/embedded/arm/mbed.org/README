16-bit Ngaro and retroImage for mbed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building on the standard retro16 VM, this is a customized version for use with
the mbed microcontroller.

To build this, load the source into the mbed compiler and build. You will need
to flash the binary to your mbed, and copy a 16-bit image (build using the
vm/experimental/retro16 sources). Rename the image to retroImg before copying
it to your mbed.

Known Bugs:

  time query is broken; it's fudged to return semi-workable values to let it
  work for simple timing loops and pass the test suite
