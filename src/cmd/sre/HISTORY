Rev 3	3/17/11
Fixed crash when trying to put an empty cut or pick buffer.
Rev 4 3/26/11
Fixed problem with delete char if the line was not in
memory & the line had tabs making it look shorter than it was.
Fixed problem where file was not marked modified on a cut
when lines were marked with mark command.
Added ability to start program with up to 4 files in the window
buffer.

Rev 5 4/19/11
Don't allow modifying files that have a mode that does not
permit it. Transfer the access mode to any new files written
based on the original file.
Preserve insertmode and search key in init file
Add a variable bell, to control if a beep is made on errors.
(set bell 0, set bell 1 on command line)
Add new command "match" assigned to keypad key "5", which
matches [], {}, and (). Just put cursor over the [], {}, or ()
and press the 5 keypad key. The matching bracket, brace or paren
will be the new cursor location. A matched failed message is
returned if no match is available.

Rev 6 6/1/11
Add "range" command to limit editing to a range of lines
within a file. Easiest way to use is to first set a mark
over the beginning brace of a function, hit ^G, then
keypad 5 to jump to the matching end brace of the function,
then ^space to get command prompt, then enter range, and the
marked area is now the range of the cursor. All commands
obey the range with the exception of a goto. So a goto 1
will always goto line 1. Turn off the range with the -range
command. You can have multiple windows open. The range applies to
only the specified window and only the file active when range
is enabled.

Rev 7 bug fix
Did not reset cursorLine ptr in open/cut/uncut commands.
Caused crashes and other wird things...

Rev 8 minor tweaks 7/19/11
Add a new "repl /xxx/yy/" command to globally replace
strings. Also fix minor nuisance of hitting escape
by accident requiring entering some keys to simulate
a multi-byte function key.
