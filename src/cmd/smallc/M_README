                ***  Moderator's README ***

This directory contains the base source code for the smallC compiler
(actually three versions:  the 8080, 6809 and vax code generators are
here also.)

The "includes" directory contains headers which are intended to be included in
user programs - the place where these files reside should be set in the Makefile
as INCDIR.  The directories "6809", "8080", and "vax" contain runtime support
for the respective compilers.  The directory "lib" contains the source code
for some common C library functions (portable ones).
