/*
 * Telnet client
 *
 * This sketch connects to a a telnet server (http://www.google.com)
 * using an Arduino Wiznet Ethernet shield.  You'll need a telnet server
 * to test this with.
 * Processing's ChatServer example (part of the network library) works well,
 * running on port 10002. It can be found as part of the examples
 * in the Processing application, available at http://processing.org/
 *
 * Circuit:
 * - Ethernet shield attached to pins 10, 11, 12, 13
 *
 * 14 Sep 2010 created by Tom Igoe
 * 16 Apr 2012 ported to RetroBSD by Serge Vakulenko
