 * USB Callback Functions
 *
 * The USB firmware stack will call the callback functions USBCBxxx() in response to certain USB related
 * events.  For example, if the host PC is powering down, it will stop sending out Start of Frame (SOF)
 * packets to your device.  In response to this, all USB devices are supposed to decrease their power
 * consumption from the USB Vbus to <2.5mA each.  The USB module detects this condition (which according
 * to the USB specifications is 3+ms of no bus activity/SOF packets) and then calls the USBCBSuspend()
 * function.  You should modify these callback functions to take appropriate actions for each of these
 * conditions.  For example, in the USBCBSuspend(), you may wish to add code that will decrease power
 * consumption from Vbus to <2.5mA (such as by clock switching, turning off LEDs, putting the
 * microcontroller to sleep, etc.).  Then, in the USBCBWakeFromSuspend() function, you may then wish to
 * add code that undoes the power saving things done in the USBCBSuspend() function.
 *
 * The USBCBSendResume() function is special, in that the USB stack will not automatically call this
 * function.  This function is meant to be called from the application firmware instead.  See the
 * additional comments near the function.

/*
 * The USB specifications allow some types of USB
 * peripheral devices to wake up a host PC (such
 * as if it is in a low power suspend to RAM state).
 * This can be a very useful feature in some
 * USB applications, such as an Infrared remote
 * control receiver.  If a user presses the "power"
 * button on a remote control, it is nice that the
 * IR receiver can detect this signalling, and then
 * send a USB "command" to the PC to wake up.
 *
 * The USBCBSendResume() "callback" function is used
 * to send this special USB signalling which wakes
 * up the PC.  This function may be called by
 * application firmware to wake up the PC.  This
 * function should only be called when:
 *
 * 1.  The USB driver used on the host PC supports
 *     the remote wakeup capability.
 * 2.  The USB configuration descriptor indicates
 *     the device is remote wakeup capable in the
 *     bmAttributes field.
 * 3.  The USB host PC is currently sleeping,
 *     and has previously sent your device a SET
 *     FEATURE setup packet which "armed" the
 *     remote wakeup capability.
 *
 * This callback should send a RESUME signal that
 * has the period of 1-15ms.
 *
 * Note: Interrupt vs. Polling
 * -Primary clock
 * -Secondary clock ***** MAKE NOTES ABOUT THIS *******
 * > Can switch to primary first by calling USBCBWakeFromSuspend()
 *
 * The modifiable section in this routine should be changed
 * to meet the application needs. Current implementation
 * temporary blocks other functions from executing for a
 * period of 1-13 ms depending on the core frequency.
 *
 * According to USB 2.0 specification section 7.1.7.7,
 * "The remote wakeup device must hold the resume signaling
 * for at lest 1 ms but for no more than 15 ms."
 * The idea here is to use a delay counter loop, using a
 * common value that would work over a wide range of core
 * frequencies.
 * That value selected is 1800. See table below:
 * ==========================================================
 * Core Freq(MHz)      MIP         RESUME Signal Period (ms)
 * ==========================================================
 *     48              12          1.05
 *      4              1           12.6
 * ==========================================================
 *  * These timing could be incorrect when using code
 *    optimization or extended instruction mode,
 *    or when having other interrupts enabled.
 *    Make sure to verify using the MPLAB SIM's Stopwatch
 *    and verify the actual signal on an oscilloscope.

 * to the _DEFAULT attribute. Available options are _SELF and _RWU.

 * Like the configuration descriptor, the endpoint descriptors were
 * changed in v2.x of the stack from a structure to a BYTE array.  As

 * please be sure to specify both bytes of the field.  For example, for
 * the endpoint size an endpoint that is 64 bytes needs to have the size
 * defined as "64,0," instead of "64,"
 *
 * Take the following example:
 *     // Endpoint Descriptor //
 *     0x07,                       //the size of this descriptor //
 *     USB_DESCRIPTOR_ENDPOINT,    //Endpoint Descriptor
 *     _EP02_IN,                   //EndpointAddress
 *     _INT,                       //Attributes
 *     0x08,0x00,                  //size (note: 2 bytes)
 *     0x02,                       //Interval
 *
 * The first two parameters are self-explanatory. They specify the
 * length of this endpoint descriptor (7) and the descriptor type.
 * The next parameter identifies the endpoint, the definitions are
 * defined in usb_device.h and has the following naming
 * convention:
 * _EP<##>_<dir>
 * where ## is the endpoint number and dir is the direction of
 * transfer. The dir has the value of either 'OUT' or 'IN'.
 * The next parameter identifies the type of the endpoint. Available
 * options are _BULK, _INT, _ISO, and _CTRL. The _CTRL is not
 * typically used because the default control transfer endpoint is
 * not defined in the USB descriptors. When _ISO option is used,
 * addition options can be ORed to _ISO. Example:
 * _ISO|_AD|_FE
 * This describes the endpoint as an isochronous pipe with adaptive
 * and feedback attributes. See usb_device.h and the USB
 * specification for details. The next parameter defines the size of
 * the endpoint. The last parameter in the polling interval.

/*
 * Adding a USB String
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A string descriptor array should have the following format:
 *
 * rom struct{byte bLength;byte bDscType;word string[size];}sdxxx={
 * sizeof(sdxxx),DSC_STR,<text>};
 *
 * The above structure provides a means for the C compiler to
 * calculate the length of string descriptor sdxxx, where xxx is the
 * index number. The first two bytes of the descriptor are descriptor
 * length and type. The rest <text> are string texts which must be
 * in the unicode format. The unicode format is achieved by declaring
 * each character as a word type. The whole text string is declared
 * as a word array with the number of characters equals to <size>.
 * <size> has to be manually counted and entered into the array
 * declaration. Let's study this through an example:
 * if the string is "USB" , then the string descriptor should be:
 * (Using index 02)
 * rom struct{byte bLength;byte bDscType;word string[3];}sd002={
 * sizeof(sd002),DSC_STR,'U','S','B'};
 *
 * A USB project may have multiple strings and the firmware supports
 * the management of multiple strings through a look-up table.
 * The look-up table is defined as:
 * rom const unsigned char *rom USB_SD_Ptr[]={&sd000,&sd001,&sd002};
 *
 * The above declaration has 3 strings, sd000, sd001, and sd002.
 * Strings can be removed or added. sd000 is a specialized string
 * descriptor. It defines the language code, usually this is
 * US English (0x0409). The index of the string must match the index
 * position of the USB_SD_Ptr array, &sd000 must be in position
 * USB_SD_Ptr[0], &sd001 must be in position USB_SD_Ptr[1] and so on.
 * The look-up table USB_SD_Ptr is used by the get string handler
 * function.
 */

/*
 * The look-up table scheme also applies to the configuration
 * descriptor. A USB device may have multiple configuration
 * descriptors, i.e. CFG01, CFG02, etc. To add a configuration
 * descriptor, user must implement a structure similar to CFG01.
 * The next step is to add the configuration descriptor name, i.e.
 * cfg01, cfg02,.., to the look-up table USB_CD_Ptr. USB_CD_Ptr[0]
 * is a dummy place holder since configuration 0 is the un-configured
 * state according to the definition in the USB specification.
